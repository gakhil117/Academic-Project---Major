Home Automation by MATLAB Using MATLAB InterfaceHome Automation by MATLAB Using MATLAB

Project demonstrates interfacing between MATLAB and Arduino board for household equipment monitoring and control.

Home automation trade has drawn the goodish attention of researchers for quite a decade. The main plan is to 
mechanically management and monitor electrical and electronic home appliances. Consistent with the marketing research firm ABI 
regarding 4 million home automation systems were subscribed globally in 2013.An equivalent firm additionally calculable that 
regarding 90 million homes would use home automation system by the top of 2017, many industrial and analysis versions of the home 
automation system are introduced and designed. A good home system has captured many technologies. Main aim of this paper is to 
propose a system which demonstrates interfacing between MATLAB and Arduino board for household equipment monitoring and 
control. In the proposed system, Arduino board is interfaced with MATLAB using serial communication to control home appliances. 
Image acquisition device is interfaced to MATLAB that will continuously show the status of household equipment’s on Graphical 
User Interface [GUI] designed in MATLAB. Proper commanding is done from MATLAB GUI, household equipment’s can be turned 
ON or OFF which are interfaced to Arduino through relay board. 


Repo also contains a rar file of code to build a working model of the project.
